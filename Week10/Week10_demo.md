Tools used: **Android Studio 4.2.1**   

[source java code here](https://github.com/saugkim/Olio2021s_LUT/blob/main/Week10/app/src/main/java/org/lut/week10) 

### Assignments  
10.1. Create a web browser application that can access internet and user can input the address manually. Make it so that the user doesn't have to input the "http://"


10.2. Create a refresh-button that can be user the refresh the website. This means the button reloads the current website.


10.3. Make an "index.html" file to Android assets-folder. After this, create a button that makes a JavaScript interface call that calls the shoutOut()-function in the file. Create another button that calls the initialize()-function. Modify the application so that when user writes "index.html" as the address, it will read the .html file.


10.4. Create previous / next buttons that enables the user to go back to the previous website or to the next (if in a previous one). You will need a place to store the previous and next websites the user has accessed.


10.5. Extend the previous / next functionalities so that user can go back and forth 10 steps. You will need some data structure to store more than one website and a way to check you are in the correct place. Modify the history functionality in such a way that when a user enter a new website after going back in the history list, the rest of the list will clear and user is back in the "newest" site (just like a real browser history works).
