5.2. Create a UML-class diagram of a bank that has different types of accounts.

Bank (class Bank) has three different accounts: marketing-, savings-, and debitaccount.  
Each account has account number and amount of money,  
Savings account (class SavingsAccount) has interest rate and a method to add interest.   
Marketing account (class MarketingAccount) has service cost and a method that can take this cost from the account.

5.3. Organize them back into order in such a way that Character-class is inherited by all the classes that are characters and WeaponBehaviour is inherited by all weapons. 
Note that all characters should have a weapon when a character is creted meaning a weapon is created at the same time a character is.
