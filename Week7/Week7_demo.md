Tools used: **Android Studio 4.2.1**

### Assignments  
7.1. Create a user interface what has one Button. Pressing the button should print "Hello World!" to the console.  
**SEE BOTTOM LEFT corner**  

<table>

    <td><img src="https://github.com/saugkim/Olio2021s_LUT/blob/main/Week7/7-1_after.PNG" width="350"/></td>

7.2. Continue from the previous exercise by creating a Label / Text Field, where you put some text. Pressing the button should now change the text so that it reads "Hello World!"

7.3. Add a text input field to the user interface. Modify the code so that when you have given text to the field and press the button, it will update the Label / Text Field to the written text.

7.4. Modify the text input field so that the Label updates without a press of a button. This means, the Label should be changed when pressing Enter (or in real time if you want). Text input field still only updates the Label.

7.5. Finally create a text editor. The program should have a text area and two buttons: Load and Save. The idea is to make the program so that the text written in the text area can be written to a file (file name is asked from the user, can be asked in a separate text field) or text can be loaded from a file (file name is asked from the user) and it updates the text field immediately after loading.
